Working as a web developer since 2008. Currently I’m focusing on building the complex web applications using JS frameworks: Vue (1 year), React (3 years), Angular (2 years). Besides I really care about good UI/UX and always trying not just build the application but deliver great experience to users. Also I believe that great projects could be completed only by high motivated teams so I’m always trying to keep team communication at a high level.
